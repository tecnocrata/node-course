# Node.js Course

This repository contains the source code for a Node.js course that covers fundamental concepts such as using JavaScript with Node.js, working with Node.js modules, managing dependencies, and testing. The course also covers more advanced topics such as Babel, Express.js, bundlers, Docker, and MongoDB.

The repository is organized into several folders, each of which contains code examples and exercises related to a particular topic. The folders are:

## JavaScript Fundamentals

The `javascript` directory contains examples and exercises for learning the basics of JavaScript. Topics include variables, data types, operators, control flow, functions, arrays, objects, and classes.

## Node Fundamentals

The `node-fundamentals` directory contains examples and exercises for learning the basics of Node.js. Topics include working with modules, the Node.js event loop, the Node.js runtime, and Node.js APIs.

## Babel

The `babel` directory contains examples and exercises for working with Babel. Topics include setting up a Babel project, using Babel with Node.js, using Babel with Webpack, and using Babel with Gulp.

## Express.js

The `expressweb` directory contains examples and exercises for working with Express.js. Topics include setting up an Express.js project, handling requests and responses, routing, middleware, and templating.

## Bundlers

The `task-runners&module-bundlers` directory contains examples and exercises for working with bundlers. Topics include setting up a project with Webpack, using loaders and plugins, code splitting, and tree shaking.

## Docker

The `docker` directory contains examples and exercises for working with Docker. Topics include setting up a Dockerfile, building a Docker image, running a Docker container, and working with Docker Compose.

## MongoDB

The `mongodb` directory contains examples and exercises for working with MongoDB. Topics include setting up a MongoDB database, creating collections, inserting and querying documents, and using the MongoDB aggregation framework.


Each folder contains a `README.md` file with more detailed information about the contents of the folder, as well as instructions on how to run the code examples and exercises.

Overall, the "node-course" repository is a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn Node.js, whether they are just starting out or are looking to expand their existing knowledge.
